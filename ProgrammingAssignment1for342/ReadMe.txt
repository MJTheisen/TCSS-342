a. Time Complexity of encode(), decode() and equal() methods in terms of Big-O notation.
     The Big O for encode should be O(n), the big O for decode should be O(n), and for equal, it 
     should be O(n) unless the two strings are exact, then it would be O(1)
    
b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of RLE? What are the applications of RLE?

     There is a disadvantage to RLE when it is used on large sequences of data the frequently
     changes between values. This may even increase the size of the data since an instance of
     a single character would result in to characters defining the size and the character. For
     example, ABCDEFGHIJ would be 1A1B1C1D1E1F1G1H1I1J.

     The advantages would be any situation when using long strings of 1's and 0's such as
     fax machines and black and white printers.

c. Amount of time you spent on implementing the assignment? Challenges you faced while
implementing the assignment? How did you overcome these challenges?

     I have currently spent an exhausting amount of time on this. I spend roughly 5 hours per day.
     I will get home around 5:00 and then work on it until bedtime. It took me the first week from 
     Monday the 24th of January until the 30th just to get the LinkedList working and from the 31st 
     until the 2nd, to get the BufferedReader and Writer to work. Today is Friday and the assignment 
     is now late by a week and I will get 5 points removed. I assumed I would have been able to finish 
     by now, but I am still having trouble getting the program to parse through the .txt file.
     I have the pseudocode written out, but I just do not know enough about Java to get it to work. 
     Everytime I think it will work, I keep getting hit with errors so what I did was take the 
     input.txt and manually type it into the section where the output.txt would import, I'm going to keep
     working on it though. I have also spent a few hours trying to figure out how to get rid of the Main 
     Class that I started with since its not supposed to be in the export file but I do not know how. 
     I also couldn't get the output to display in a LinkedList form because the method kept messing up.
     Also compression ratio. Would more time help? I think so, yes. I did work on this until the last moment.
     I had to spend a significant amount of time learning new things that we didn't do in class and
      have never covered in previous classes.
