a. I am just using the hash function we developed in class but was trying new primes.

b. The main advantage is speed but you need the right hash function. Password verification
is one method of use I find interesting. It has to use your username and password as part
of the table using the key

c. I spent a few days working on this. Other assignments that were mandatory to do first
took precedence.

I implemented the Hash Table to the best of my abilities.

I worked literally up until the last minute, but was under the assumption we had until
the 16th to finish until about a week ago when I found out that the assignment would be
due on the 13th while working on my AssemblySimulator for 371.

Obviously this is not complete. I still have not figured out how to pass information from
and to a .txt file into Java cleanly. None of the tutorials online are sufficient, and I
have spent around 60 hours just trying to figure out that step. I am trying to pass the
string into a string array without using arrayList.

The HashTable implementation to a few days (17 hours) but I got it working with much help from the
debugger.

I will continue to work on this because I find it interesting but not for a few days
since I have three finals to study for.
