a. Height of the Huffman Tree in terms of n, where n is the number of unique
characters in the string. Time Complexity of encode() and decode() methods
in terms of Big-O notation.

Time complexity of encoding  O(n) and decoding O(1)

b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Huffman Coding? Do you
think using a simple Queue (FIFO) implementation for Huffman encoding will
improve or deteriorate the compression ratio ?




c. Amount of time you spent on implementing the assignment. Challenges you faced
while implementing the assignment? How did you overcome these challenges?
